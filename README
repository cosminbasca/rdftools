the rdftools module contains a wrapper around the RAPTOR2 RDF library
the followin scripts are provided:

- rdfconvert.py
    convert RDF from various formats to other formats

- genlubm.py
    call the LUBM generator, the classes can be located at LUBM_PATH (can also be set as an env var!)
    - LUBM 1.7 (patched) is bundled with the script, so no need to setup the path before running, just call the script in your desired location
     :)
