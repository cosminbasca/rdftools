Description: the rdftools module contains a wrapper around the RAPTOR2 RDF library
        the followin scripts are provided:
        
        - rdfconvert.py
            convert RDF from various formats to other formats
        
        - genlubm.py
            call the LUBM generator, the classes can be located at LUBM_PATH (can also be set as an env var!)
            - LUBM 1.7 (patched) is bundled with the script, so no need to setup the path before running, just call the script in your desired location
             :)
